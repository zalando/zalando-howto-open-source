## Zalando's README Template

Clear documentation is critical to the success of your project. This checklist is meant to help you cover all your bases. Not every section/subsection will be relevant to your project; pick and choose what is. Inspired by READMEs of very successful projects like etcd.

Please copy-paste this into a new document and save as you build your READMEs. For alternative formats, you might create a [Structured README](https://github.com/shaloo/structuredreadme), which offers a thorough breakdown of optional README ingredients for you to consider. You might also take a look at [this similar checklist](https://github.com/cfpb/open-source-project-template); or check out [art-of-readme](https://github.com/noffle/art-of-readme).
